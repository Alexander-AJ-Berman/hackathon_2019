# SAP 2019 - Synchronized Airpods Player

SAP is a fully developed web application for the synchronization of multiple users' Spotify experiences. By joining a room owned by a singular host, a user can have their Spotify completely synchronized with any number of guests. With applications from a Silent Disco to amplification on the go, SAP provides users the oppurtunity to be fully in-tuned with their friends - in whatever form they so desire.
